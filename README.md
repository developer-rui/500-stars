# 500-stars

A website for viewing the live starry sky depending on the user's location and current time.

You can have a live view of 500 of the brightest stars, the planets, the Sun and the Moon!

The backend is implemented with Python/Flask, and the frontend (including the calculation of the position of the stars) is implemented with Javascript.
